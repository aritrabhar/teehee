          <strong>YOU'RE MY VALENTINE NOW MWEHEHEHE.</strong> let me start by saying HAPPY ONE AND A HALF YEARS OF DATING!!! even tho we had our break in between, i think going our own ways made us realize just how much life was better with the other person in it. you've been there for me thru some of the hardest parts of my life (cough cough mcdonalds). i love everything about you chloé. i really do. i love your smile (even if you think its gummy or whatever bullshit), i love how you can pull off curly and straight hair flawlessly, i love your work ethic and how genius you are, i love how you act like a feminist in front of your friends but like a little cutie patootie with me (cause you are hehe), i love how even on your busiest days you still make time to talk, i love how thoughtful your gifts are, i love the little fights we have whenever someone has to pay (even if i always win lol), and i LOVE how you actually find me attractive. that last one still feels like a shocker lol. im SO grateful to have you in my life. here's to one gorillion more years of dating!
